While it's important to make a good impression, it's also important to be yourself and make sure you're both comfortable. To ensure your first date goes smoothly, here are 10 things you should absolutely not do.<br><br>1. Talk About Yourself Endlessly<br><br>It's natural to want to talk about yourself on a first date, but it's important to remember to ask your date questions too. Ask them about their interests, hobbies, and family. Showing genuine interest in them will make them feel more comfortable and create a more enjoyable conversation.<br><br>2. Quiz Them<br><br>No one likes to be quizzed on a first date. While it's important to ask questions to get to know your date, avoid making it feel like an interrogation. Ask open-ended questions that will allow them to talk more freely and provide more information about themselves.<br><br>3. Dismiss Them Because They're Not Your Type<br><br>It's easy to dismiss someone because they're not your type, but it's important to keep an open mind. You never know who you might connect with, so give them a chance and see if there's a spark.<br><br>4. Have Your Phone on the Table<br><br>Having your phone on the table is a huge distraction and can make your date feel like you're not interested in them. Put your phone away and give your date your full attention.<br><br>5. Talk About Your Ex<br><br>Talking about your ex on a first date is a big no-no. It can make your date feel uncomfortable and give them the wrong impression. Keep the conversation focused on the present and get to know each other.<br><br>6. Avoid Eye Contact<br><br>Eye contact is an important part of communication and can make a big difference in how your date perceives you. Make sure to look your date in the eye when they're talking to show that you're interested and engaged in the conversation.<br><br>7. Drink Too Much Alcohol<br><br>Having a drink or two on a first date can help you relax, but it's important to be mindful of how much you're drinking. Drinking too much can make you appear sloppy and unprofessional, and it can also make it difficult to remember the details of the date.<br><br>8. Wear Something Uncomfortable<br><br>First impressions are important, so it's important to dress appropriately for the occasion. However, it's also important to make sure you're comfortable. Wearing something that's too tight or too loose can make you feel self-conscious and take away from the date.<br><br>9. Be Late<br><br>Showing up late to a first date is a surefire way to make a bad impression. Make sure to plan ahead and give yourself plenty of time to get to the date on time.<br><br>10. Have Unrealistic Expectations<br><br>It's important to have realistic expectations for a first date. Don't expect it to be perfect or for it to lead to a long-term relationship. Just enjoy the moment and take it one step at a time.<br><br>Following these tips will help ensure that your first date goes smoothly and that you make a good impression. Remember to be yourself and have fun!</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
