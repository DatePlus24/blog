It is important to make a good impression on your date and make sure that the evening is enjoyable for both of you. To ensure that your date goes as smoothly as possible, here are 10 things you should avoid doing on a date.<br><br><strong>Arrive Late</strong><br><br>Showing up late for your date is a surefire way to make a bad impression. Not only does it show a lack of respect for your date, but it also shows that you are not reliable or punctual. If you are running late, make sure to call your date and let them know.<br><br><strong>Talk About Ex-Girlfriends</strong><br><br>Talking about your ex-girlfriends on a date is a definite no-no. Not only is it disrespectful to your date, but it also makes it seem like you are still hung up on your past relationships.<br><br><strong>Use Your Phone</strong><br><br>It is important to be present and engaged during your date. Constantly checking your phone or texting while you are out with your date is a surefire way to make them feel unimportant and unappreciated.<br><br><strong>Be Rude to the Waiter</strong><br><br>It is important to be respectful to the people around you, especially when you are out on a date. Being rude to the waiter or other staff members can be a huge turn-off for your date.<br><br><strong>Be Distracted</strong><br><br>It is important to be present and engaged during your date. Being distracted by other people or things going on around you can make your date feel like you are not interested in them or the conversation.<br><br><strong>Go Too Intense</strong><br><br>It is important to take things slow on a first date. Going too intense too quickly can make your date feel uncomfortable and overwhelmed.<br><br><strong>Make Her Pay</strong><br><br>On a first date, it is generally expected that the man will pay for the meal. Making your date pay for her own meal can make her feel like you are not interested in her or that you are trying to take advantage of her.<br><br><strong>Get Really Drunk</strong><br><br>Drinking on a date is perfectly fine, but it is important to stay in control. Getting really drunk can make your date feel uncomfortable and can also lead to bad decisions.<br><br><strong>Forget to Compliment</strong><br><br>It is important to make your date feel special and appreciated. Complimenting them on their looks or personality can make them feel good and show them that you are interested in them.<br><br><strong>Forget to Listen</strong><br><br>It is important to be an active listener when you are out on a date. Listening to your date and engaging in the conversation can make them feel like you are interested in them and what they have to say.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
