Here are seven red flags you should be aware of when you meet someone new online.<br><br><strong>1. They Ask You for Money</strong><br><br>If someone you meet online starts asking for money, it's a major red flag. No matter what they say, it's never a good idea to give money to someone you don't know well.<br><br><strong>2. They Warn You About Themselves</strong><br><br>If someone you meet online tells you about their bad qualities or warns you about their behavior, it's a sign that they may not be trustworthy.<br><br><strong>3. They Say "I Love You" Within Days</strong><br><br>If someone you meet online says "I love you" within days of meeting, it's a red flag. It's normal to feel a connection with someone, but it's important to take things slow and get to know them better before making any declarations of love.<br><br><strong>4. They Won't Send You Pictures</strong><br><br>If someone you meet online refuses to send you pictures, it's a sign that they may not be who they say they are. It's important to get a sense of who you're talking to before meeting in person.<br><br><strong>5. They Give Vague Answers on Their Profile</strong><br><br>If someone you meet online has a profile that is filled with vague answers or doesn't provide much information, it's a sign that they may not be serious about finding a relationship.<br><br><strong>6. They Talk About Their Ex</strong><br><br>If someone you meet online talks a lot about their ex, it's a sign that they may not be ready to move on. It's important to take things slow and make sure that they are emotionally available before getting too involved.<br><br><strong>7. They Go Heavy on the Sweet-Talk</strong><br><br>If someone you meet online is overly complimentary or sweet-talks you a lot, it's a sign that they may not be genuine. It's important to take things slow and get to know someone before getting too involved.<br><br>Online dating can be a great way to meet people, but it's important to be aware of the potential risks. Pay attention to these seven red flags and you'll be better equipped to spot potential problems before they arise.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
