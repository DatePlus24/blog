To make sure your first date goes as smoothly as possible, here are some tips on what not to do.<br><br>1. Don't Talk About Yourself Endlessly<br><br>It's natural to want to talk about yourself on a first date, but it's important to make sure you don't dominate the conversation. Ask your date questions about themselves and listen to their answers.<br><br>2. Don't Quiz Them<br><br>Asking too many questions can make your date feel like they're being interrogated. Instead, try to have a natural conversation and let the conversation flow.<br><br>3. Don't Dismiss Them Because They're Not Your Type<br><br>Just because someone isn't your type doesn't mean you should dismiss them. Give them a chance and get to know them. You might be surprised at how much you have in common.<br><br>4. Don't Have Your Phone on the Table<br><br>Having your phone on the table is a surefire way to make your date feel like they're not important. Keep your phone in your pocket or purse and give your date your full attention.<br><br>5. Don't Talk About Your Ex<br><br>Talking about your ex on a first date is a big no-no. Not only is it rude, but it can also make your date feel uncomfortable.<br><br>6. Don't Avoid Eye Contact<br><br>Eye contact is an important part of communication and it's important to make sure you maintain it during your date. It will show your date that you're engaged in the conversation and interested in what they have to say.<br><br>7. Don't Drink Too Much Alcohol<br><br>It's perfectly fine to have a drink or two on a first date, but it's important to make sure you don't overdo it. Drinking too much can make you appear sloppy and unprofessional.<br><br>Following these tips will help ensure that your first date goes as smoothly as possible. Remember to be yourself and have fun!</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
