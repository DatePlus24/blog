To protect yourself from being catfished, it's important to know the signs of a potential scammer. Here are seven signs to look out for if you think you may be being catfished on a dating site.<br><br>1. They Won't Pick Up a Phone Call<br><br>If the person you're talking to on a dating site won't pick up a phone call, it could be a sign that they're not who they say they are. Catfishers often use fake numbers to avoid talking to their victims on the phone.<br><br>2. They Don't Have Many Followers or Friends<br><br>If the person you're talking to doesn't have many followers or friends on social media, it could be a sign that they're using a fake profile. Catfishers often create fake profiles with limited connections to make it harder for their victims to verify their identity.<br><br>3. Their Story Doesn't Add Up<br><br>If the person you're talking to has a story that doesn't add up, it could be a sign that they're lying. Catfishers often create elaborate stories to gain their victims' trust and make it harder for them to verify the truth.<br><br>4. They're Using Someone Else's Photos<br><br>If the person you're talking to is using someone else's photos, it could be a sign that they're not who they say they are. Catfishers often use photos of other people to create fake profiles and gain their victims' trust.<br><br>5. Their Only Photos Are Professional<br><br>If the person you're talking to only has professional photos, it could be a sign that they're not who they say they are. Catfishers often use professional photos to make their fake profiles look more believable.<br><br>6. They've Never Sent You a Casual Selfie<br><br>If the person you're talking to has never sent you a casual selfie, it could be a sign that they're not who they say they are. Catfishers often avoid sending casual selfies to make it harder for their victims to verify their identity.<br><br>7. They're Reluctant to Meet in Real Life or Even Video Chat<br><br>If the person you're talking to is reluctant to meet in real life or even video chat, it could be a sign that they're not who they say they are. Catfishers often avoid meeting their victims in person or video chatting to make it harder for them to verify their identity.<br><br>By being aware of these signs, you can protect yourself from being catfished on a dating site. If you suspect that you're being catfished, it's important to stop communicating with the person and report them to the dating site.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="banner banner--after-post"><a href="https://siteoff.github.io/registration"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singleconnect24/img/main/clickUSA2.jpg" alt="Dating USA"></a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
