This has been true for centuries, with studies showing that men are more likely to engage in extramarital affairs than women.<br><br><strong>Infidelity Rate Peaked Among Men in Their 50s in the 1990s:</strong><br>In the 1990s, the infidelity rate peaked among men in their 50s. In that decade, older men were less likely to cheat than those who were middle aged.
