It can be hard to tell if someone is being genuine or if they’re just looking for a good time. Here’s how to spot a player (online and off) so you can protect your heart.<br><br><strong>He Comes On Strong</strong><br>If the guy you’re talking to is coming on too strong, it could be a sign that he’s only looking for a good time. He might be trying to rush you into a relationship or make you feel like you’re the only one he’s interested in. If this is the case, it’s best to take a step back and get to know him better before committing to anything.<br><br><strong>He Says He’s “Open” to a Relationship</strong><br>If a guy is playing you, he might tell you that he’s open to a relationship but never actually commit to one. He might also make excuses for why he can’t commit or why he can’t meet up in person. If he’s not willing to take the next step, it could be a sign that he’s not serious about you.<br><br><strong>He Makes Sex Jokes Early</strong><br>If a guy is making sexual jokes or innuendos early on in the conversation, it could be a sign that he’s only looking for a physical relationship. If he’s not interested in getting to know you on a deeper level, it’s best to move on.<br><br><strong>He Only Texts You Late at Night</strong><br>If a guy is only texting you late at night, it could be a sign that he’s only looking for a hookup. If he’s not interested in having a real conversation or getting to know you better, it’s best to move on.<br><br><strong>He Doesn’t Ask Personal Questions</strong><br>If a guy isn’t asking you personal questions or getting to know you on a deeper level, it could be a sign that he’s not interested in a real relationship. If he’s not asking about your family, your hobbies, or your dreams, it’s best to move on.<br><br><strong>He Asks for Sexy Pics</strong><br>If a guy is asking for sexy pics or trying to get you to send him nudes, it’s a sign that he’s only looking for a physical relationship. If he’s not interested in getting to know you on a deeper level, it’s best to move on.<br><br><strong>He Gives Over-the-Top Compliments</strong><br>If a guy is giving you over-the-top compliments or telling you that you’re perfect, it could be a sign that he’s trying to manipulate you. If he’s not interested in getting to know you on a deeper level, it’s best to move on.<br><br><strong>He Won’t Introduce You to His Friends</strong><br>If a guy is playing you, he might not be willing to introduce you to his friends or family. If he’s not willing to take the next step and make you a part of his life, it’s best to move on.<br><br>It can be hard to tell if a guy is playing you online, but there are some signs to look out for. If he’s coming on too strong, making sexual jokes, or not asking personal questions, it could be a sign that he’s not interested in a real relationship. If he’s not willing to take the next step and introduce you to his friends, it’s best to move on. By being aware of these signs, you can protect your heart and make sure you’re not being taken advantage of.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
