This is a question that many people have when it comes to using the popular dating app. The answer is no, as Hinge has recently introduced a new feature called “Your Turn” which allows users to decide who makes the first move, regardless of gender.<br><br><strong>What is Hinge's “Your Turn” Feature?</strong><br><br>Hinge's “Your Turn” feature is designed to give users more control over who makes the first move in conversations on the app. The feature allows users to decide who makes the first move, regardless of gender, and then reminds users when it's their turn to respond. This eliminates the pressure of having to make the first move and allows users to take their time in getting to know each other.<br><br><strong>How Does “Your Turn” Work?</strong><br><br>The “Your Turn” feature is easy to use. When a user receives a message from another user, they will be prompted to either respond or pass. If they choose to respond, they will be taken to a conversation page where they can start chatting. If they choose to pass, they will be taken to the next profile in their queue.<br><br>The “Your Turn” feature also has a reminder system that will send notifications to users when it's their turn to respond. This ensures that conversations don't go stale and keeps users engaged.<br><br><strong>Benefits of “Your Turn”</strong><br><br>The “Your Turn” feature has several benefits for users. First, it eliminates the pressure of having to make the first move, which can be intimidating for some users. Second, it allows users to take their time in getting to know each other before deciding to move forward with a conversation. Third, it keeps conversations going by reminding users when it's their turn to respond.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>Hinge's “Your Turn” feature is a great way for users to take control of their conversations on the app. The feature eliminates the pressure of having to make the first move and allows users to take their time in getting to know each other. It also keeps conversations going by reminding users when it's their turn to respond. With “Your Turn”, users no longer have to worry about who should message first – the decision is up to them.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
