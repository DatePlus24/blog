After all, you want to trust them and give them the benefit of the doubt. But if you're starting to suspect that something isn't quite right, then it's important to take a step back and look for the signs that your guy is playing you.</p><h3>Here are some tell-tale signs that your guy is not being honest with you:</h3><p><strong>1. He's Reluctant to Commit</strong><br><br>If your guy is reluctant to commit to anything more than two weeks in the future, then this could be a sign that he's playing you. If he tries to change the subject any time you try to talk about the future, even if you're only talking about your holiday plans, which are a month away, then this may be a sign that he's playing you.<br><br><strong>2. He's Hot and Cold</strong><br><br>Another sign that your guy is playing you is if he's hot and cold. If he's always blowing hot and cold, then this could be a sign that he's not being honest with you. One minute he's telling you he loves you and the next he's distant and aloof. This could be a sign that he's not sure what he wants and is trying to keep his options open.<br><br><strong>3. He's Not Open About His Life</strong><br><br>If your guy is not open about his life, then this could be a sign that he's playing you. If he's not willing to share details about his life, such as his job, his friends, or his family, then this could be a sign that he's not being honest with you.<br><br><strong>4. He's Not Interested in Your Life</strong><br><br>If your guy is not interested in your life, then this could be a sign that he's playing you. If he's not interested in what you have to say or what you're doing, then this could be a sign that he's not invested in the relationship.<br><br><strong>5. He's Always Busy</strong><br><br>If your guy is always busy and never has time for you, then this could be a sign that he's playing you. If he's always making excuses for why he can't spend time with you, then this could be a sign that he's not being honest with you.<br><br>If you're starting to suspect that your guy is playing you, then it's important to take a step back and look for the signs. If he's reluctant to commit, hot and cold, not open about his life, not interested in your life, or always busy, then this could be a sign that he's not being honest with you.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="banner banner--after-post"><a href="https://siteoff.github.io/registration"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singleconnect24/img/main/clickUSA1.jpg" alt="Dating USA"></a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
