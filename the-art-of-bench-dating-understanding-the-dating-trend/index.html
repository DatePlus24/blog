One of the latest additions is the term "benching," which has caused confusion among many people. In this article, we'll take a closer look at what benching means in dating and how it differs from other dating practices.</p><p>Definition of Bench Dating: Bench dating, as defined by Urban Dictionary, is the practice of keeping someone as an option while you continue to date other people. In other words, you like someone enough to continue seeing them, but you're not ready to commit to a serious relationship with them. Essentially, you're keeping them "on the bench" while you explore your options.</p><p>How it Differs from Other Dating Practices: Bench dating is different from ghosting, in which you simply stop responding to someone's messages or calls without explanation. It's also different from breadcrumbing, in which you keep someone interested by sending sporadic messages or flirting, but never actually following through on plans to meet. With benching, you continue to see the person, but you keep your options open.</p><p>The Pros and Cons of Bench Dating: While bench dating may seem like a convenient way to keep your options open, it can also have some negative consequences. Here are some of the pros and cons of bench dating:</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>You can continue to see someone you like without committing to a serious relationship</li><li>You can take the time to determine whether or not you're ready for a serious relationship</li><li>You can avoid hurting someone's feelings by letting them know up front that you're not ready for a commitment</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>You may lead someone on by keeping them as an option</li><li>You may miss out on a great relationship if you continue to date other people and never fully commit to the person you're benching</li><li>The person you're benching may eventually become frustrated and move on, leaving you with no one to fall back on</li></ul><p>Conclusion: In conclusion, bench dating is a practice that has both pros and cons. It can be a convenient way to keep your options open while you explore your feelings, but it can also lead to confusion and hurt feelings. Ultimately, the decision to bench someone or not is a personal one, and it's up to each individual to weigh the pros and cons and make the best choice for themselves.</p><p>As always, the key to successful dating is to be honest and clear with your intentions. If you're not ready for a serious relationship, let the person you're seeing know up front. By being upfront and honest, you can avoid leading someone on and potentially hurting their feelings in the long run.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
