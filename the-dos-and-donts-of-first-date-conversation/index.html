To make sure you have a successful and enjoyable evening, it is important to know what topics are inappropriate to discuss. Here are some of the things to avoid when engaging in conversation on a first date.<br><br><strong>Money</strong><br><br>No matter how much or how little you have, money should never be a part of a first-date conversation. Personal finances tend to bring up strong emotions and even long-term couples have difficulty talking about money.<br><br><strong>Politics</strong><br><br>Political conversations can be quite heated and divisive, so it is best to avoid them on a first date. You don't want to make your date feel uncomfortable or risk getting into an argument.<br><br><strong>Exes</strong><br><br>Talking about your ex or your date's ex is a definite no-no. It can make your date feel insecure and it is likely to lead to an awkward and uncomfortable conversation.<br><br><strong>Health</strong><br><br>Health issues are best left for a later date. Discussing medical conditions or past surgeries can be off-putting and it can make your date feel uncomfortable.<br><br><strong>Religion</strong><br><br>Religion is a sensitive topic and should be avoided on a first date. It is important to respect each other's beliefs and not to get into a debate.<br><br><strong>Family</strong><br><br>Family conversations can be a minefield and it is best to steer clear of them on a first date. Talking about family issues can be quite personal and it is best to wait until you get to know each other better.<br><br>When it comes to conversation on a first date, it is important to be mindful of the topics you discuss. Money, politics, exes, health, religion, and family are all topics that should be avoided. Keep the conversation light and fun and you are sure to have a successful and enjoyable evening.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
