It is a commitment that is meant to be honored and respected. Unfortunately, there are times when marriages become sexless, leaving couples feeling disconnected and unhappy. In this article, we will explore the current statistics of sexless marriages and discuss the reasons why this is happening.<br><br><strong>What Percentage of Marriages are Sexless?</strong><br><br>Recent studies have shown that 25 to 50 percent of marriages are sexless in 2022. This is a startling statistic that highlights the prevalence of sexless marriages in today's society. While this may seem like a high number, it is important to note that this is not a new phenomenon. Sexless marriages have been around for centuries, and the number of couples affected by this issue has been steadily increasing over the years.<br><br><strong>Reasons for Sexless Marriages</strong><br><br>There are many reasons why marriages become sexless. One of the most common reasons is a lack of communication between partners. When couples do not communicate openly and honestly about their needs and desires, it can lead to feelings of resentment and disconnection. This can lead to a decrease in physical intimacy, which can ultimately lead to a sexless marriage.<br><br>Other factors that can contribute to a sexless marriage include physical and mental health issues, financial stress, and relationship issues. For example, if one partner is struggling with depression or anxiety, it can be difficult for them to feel comfortable engaging in physical intimacy. Similarly, if a couple is dealing with financial stress, it can be difficult for them to prioritize physical intimacy. Finally, if there are unresolved issues in the relationship, such as infidelity or a lack of trust, it can lead to a decrease in physical intimacy.<br><br>The statistics of sexless marriages are alarming, and it is important to understand the underlying causes of this issue. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, it is important for couples to communicate openly and honestly about their needs and desires. This can help to foster a deeper connection and increase physical intimacy. Additionally, couples should seek professional help if they are struggling with mental health issues, financial stress, or relationship issues. With the right support, couples can work together to create a fulfilling and satisfying marriage.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
