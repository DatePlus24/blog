This article will discuss some of the common warning signs to look out for when you are first dating someone.<br><br>1. Too Much Physicality<br><br>If your date is overly touchy or sexual right away, it could be a sign that they are not respecting your physical and sexual boundaries. This could be a sign that they are not respecting your wishes and that they are not someone you want to pursue a relationship with.<br><br>2. Constant Complaining<br><br>If your date is constantly complaining or is overly critical, especially of you, it could be a sign that they are not the right person for you. This type of behavior is a red flag that the person may not be compatible with you and that they may not be interested in having a meaningful relationship.<br><br>3. Being Late<br><br>If your date is consistently late or does not inform you ahead of time, it could be a sign that they are not taking the date seriously. This could be a sign that they are not interested in having a meaningful relationship and that they may not be the right person for you.<br><br>4. Not Listening<br><br>If your date is not listening to you or is not interested in what you have to say, it could be a sign that they are not interested in having a meaningful relationship. This could be a sign that they are not compatible with you and that they may not be the right person for you.<br><br>5. Poor Communication<br><br>If your date is not communicating with you or is not being open and honest, it could be a sign that they are not interested in having a meaningful relationship. This could be a sign that they are not compatible with you and that they may not be the right person for you.<br><br>These are just a few of the red flags to look out for when you are first dating someone. It is important to be aware of these warning signs and to trust your instincts if something does not feel right. If you are ever in doubt, it is best to take a step back and reevaluate the situation.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
