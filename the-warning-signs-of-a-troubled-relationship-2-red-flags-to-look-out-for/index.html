Here are two red flags to look out for that could be signs of a troubled relationship.<br><br><strong>Excessive Jealousy</strong><br><br>One of the biggest red flags in a relationship is excessive jealousy. Jealousy is a normal emotion, but when it becomes too intense or controlling, it can be a sign of a bigger problem. If your partner is constantly questioning you about your whereabouts, accusing you of cheating, or monitoring your social media accounts, it could be a sign that they are feeling insecure in the relationship.<br><br><strong>Frequent Lying</strong><br><br>Another red flag in a relationship is frequent lying. If your partner is lying to you about their whereabouts, activities, or other important matters, it could be a sign that they are not being honest with you. It could also be a sign that they are trying to hide something from you.<br><br><strong>Unwillingness to Compromise</strong><br><br>An unwillingness to compromise is another major red flag in a relationship. If your partner is not willing to meet you halfway or make any concessions, it could be a sign that they are not interested in making the relationship work. Relationships should be based on mutual respect and understanding, and if one partner is not willing to compromise, it could be a sign that the relationship is not healthy.<br><br><strong>Criticism and Put-Downs</strong><br><br>Finally, be wary of a partner who frequently criticizes you or puts you down. This type of behavior can be damaging to your self-esteem and can be a sign of a toxic relationship. If your partner is constantly belittling you or making you feel bad about yourself, it could be a sign that they are not interested in a healthy relationship.<br><br>When it comes to relationships, it’s important to be aware of the warning signs that could indicate trouble ahead. Excessive jealousy, frequent lying, an unwillingness to compromise, and criticism and put-downs are all red flags that could be signs of a troubled relationship. If you notice any of these signs in your relationship, it’s important to take action and address the issue before it gets worse.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
