These include:<br><br>• No commitment: Situationships are often characterized by a lack of commitment. There is no expectation of exclusivity or a long-term future.<br><br>• No labels: Situationships are not defined by labels like “boyfriend” or “girlfriend”. This can make it difficult to define the relationship and understand where it’s going.<br><br>• Limited communication: Situationships are often characterized by limited communication.

It can be difficult to know where the relationship is going or what the other person is thinking.<br><br><strong>Signs You’re in a Situationship</strong><br><br>If you’re not sure if you’re in a situationship, there are a few signs to look out for. These include:<br><br>• No commitment: If you’re not sure if you’re in a committed relationship, it’s likely you’re in a situationship.<br><br>• No labels: If you’re not sure what to call the other person or how to define the relationship, it’s likely you’re in a situationship.<br><br>• Limited communication: If you’re not talking regularly or discussing your relationship, it’s likely you’re in a situationship.<br><br>• Uncertainty: If you’re not sure where the relationship is going or what the other person is thinking, it’s likely you’re in a situationship.<br><br>Situationships can be confusing and difficult to navigate.
