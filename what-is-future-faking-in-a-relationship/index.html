It involves creating a detailed vision of the future that may or may not be based in reality. This can be used to control the other person in the relationship, as well as to create a false sense of security and connection.<br><br><strong>Understanding Future Faking</strong><br><br>Future faking is when someone uses a detailed vision of the future to facilitate the bonding and connection in a romantic relationship, according to Greg Kushnick, PsyD, a psychologist based in New York City. It is generally something narcissists do, added Dr. Kushnick.<br><br><strong>Signs of Future Faking</strong><br><br>Future faking can be difficult to detect, as it often appears to be a sign of genuine commitment. However, there are some signs that can indicate future faking is taking place in a relationship. These include:<br><br>• Making grand promises or declarations about the future without any concrete plans to back them up.<br><br>• Making plans that are far-fetched or unrealistic.<br><br>• Making promises that are not kept.<br><br>• Not following through on commitments.<br><br>• Constantly changing plans or expectations.<br><br>• Making decisions without consulting the other person.<br><br>• Using guilt or manipulation to get the other person to agree to their plans.<br><br><strong>Effects of Future Faking</strong><br><br>Future faking can have a detrimental effect on a relationship. It can create a false sense of security and connection, which can lead to the other person feeling betrayed or manipulated when the promises are not kept. It can also lead to feelings of resentment and distrust, as well as confusion and insecurity.<br><br><strong>How to Deal with Future Faking</strong><br><br>If you suspect that your partner is future faking, it is important to address the issue. Talk to your partner about your concerns and make sure that they understand the implications of their actions. It is also important to set boundaries and make sure that both parties are on the same page when it comes to making plans and commitments.<br><br>Future faking is a manipulative tactic used by some people in romantic relationships to create a false sense of security and connection.
