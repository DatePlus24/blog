It is known for its unique matching algorithm and user-friendly interface. But what percentage of girls are on Hinge?<br><br><strong>Recent Demographics</strong><br><br>According to a recent survey conducted in February 2020, Hinge demographics appear to be 64% male to 36% female users in terms of possession. This means that out of every 100 users, 36 are female.<br><br><strong>Why is the Percentage of Female Users Lower?</strong><br><br>There are several reasons why the percentage of female users on Hinge is lower than the percentage of male users. One of the main reasons is that many women feel uncomfortable using dating apps. This is due to the fact that they may be subject to harassment or inappropriate behavior from other users.<br><br>Another reason is that some women may not be comfortable with the idea of online dating in general. They may feel that it is too impersonal or that it is not the right way to meet someone.<br><br>Finally, some women may not be aware of Hinge or may not be interested in using it. This could be due to a lack of knowledge about the app or simply because they prefer to meet people in person.<br><br>Overall, the percentage of female users on Hinge is lower than the percentage of male users. This is due to a variety of factors, including the fact that many women feel uncomfortable using dating apps, may not be comfortable with the idea of online dating, or may not be aware of Hinge. Despite this, the percentage of female users is still significant and is likely to increase in the future.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="banner banner--after-post"><a href="https://siteoff.github.io/registration"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singleconnect24/img/main/clickUSA1.jpg" alt="Dating USA"></a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
