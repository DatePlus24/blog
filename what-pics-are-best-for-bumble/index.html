With the rise of dating apps like Bumble, it’s important to know what pics are best for your profile. From smiling to avoiding certain poses, here’s what you need to know to make your profile stand out.<br><br><strong>Show Off Those Pearly Whites</strong><br><br>As clichéd as it sounds, including pictures where you’re smiling is super important. “People are attracted to happy people,” dating coach and matchmaker Tennesha Wood says. She suggests avoiding pictures where your face is covered, say with sunglasses or a hat. Instead, opt for pictures that show off your personality and show that you’re approachable.<br><br><strong>Choose Pictures That Showcase Your Interests</strong><br><br>Another great way to stand out on Bumble is to include pictures that showcase your interests. Whether it’s a photo of you playing your favorite sport or one of you traveling, these pics can give potential matches an idea of what you’re passionate about.<br><br><strong>Include Variety</strong><br><br>When it comes to your profile pictures, it’s important to include a variety of shots. This means having a mix of close-up and full-body shots, as well as solo and group photos. This will give potential matches a better idea of who you are and what you look like.<br><br><strong>Choose Photos That Show You in Your Best Light</strong><br><br>When selecting your profile pictures, make sure to choose ones that show you in your best light. This means avoiding pictures that are too dark or blurry. You should also avoid pictures that are too posed or overly edited.<br><br><strong>Avoid Provocative Pics</strong><br><br>When it comes to your profile pictures, it’s important to avoid anything too provocative. This means avoiding pictures that are too sexual or suggestive. Instead, opt for pics that show off your personality and make you look approachable.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>Having the right profile pictures on Bumble is key to finding success. From smiling to showcasing your interests, there are a few things to keep in mind when selecting your pics. Make sure to choose pictures that show you in your best light and avoid anything too provocative. With the right profile pictures, you’ll be sure to make a great first impression.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
