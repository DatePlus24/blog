You want to make sure that you present yourself in the best light possible and avoid any potential pitfalls. But what should you not put on a dating profile?<br><br><strong>What You're *Not* Looking For</strong><br><br>When it comes to online dating, it's important to be honest about what you're looking for. But that doesn't mean you should list all the qualities you don't want in a partner. Including criteria for who shouldn't swipe left or message you is just a real Debbie Downer move.<br><br><strong>Anything Too Generic</strong><br><br>Generic phrases like "I'm looking for someone special" or "I'm open to anything" don't give potential matches much to go on. Instead, focus on what you do want in a partner and use specific examples.<br><br><strong>Sarcasm About Being on 'The Apps'</strong><br><br>We get it: online dating can be exhausting. But making sarcastic comments about it in your profile isn't going to make it any better. It's best to stay positive and focus on the potential of finding someone great.<br><br><strong>Lies (or Even Exaggerations)</strong><br><br>When it comes to online dating, honesty is the best policy. Lying or exaggerating about your age, interests, or lifestyle won't get you very far. It's better to be upfront and honest about who you are and what you're looking for.<br><br><strong>*No Information*</strong><br><br>Your profile should be a reflection of who you are and what you're looking for. Leaving it blank or just putting in a few words isn't going to give potential matches much to go on. Make sure to include enough information about yourself so that people can get a good sense of who you are.<br><br>Creating a successful dating profile can be tricky, but it doesn't have to be. By avoiding the things you shouldn't put on a dating profile, you can make sure that you present yourself in the best light possible. With a little bit of effort, you can find the perfect match for you.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
