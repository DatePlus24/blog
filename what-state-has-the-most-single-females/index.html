With a variety of factors to consider, such as age, marital status, and location, it can be difficult to determine which state has the most single females. To make the search easier, we have compiled a list of the top 17 states with the highest percentage of single females.<br><br><strong>Rank State Share Single</strong></p><p><code>1 Louisiana 55.7%</code><br><code>2 Rhode Island 55.7%</code><br><code>3 New York 55.4%</code><br><code>4 Mississippi 54.9%</code><br><code>5 Hawaii 54.6%</code><br><code>6 Alaska 54.5%</code><br><code>7 Florida 54.4%</code><br><code>8 Massachusetts 54.2%</code><br><code>9 Connecticut 54.1%</code><br><code>10 Maryland 53.9%</code><br><code>11 California 53.8%</code><br><code>12 New Jersey 53.7%</code><br><code>13 Delaware 53.6%</code><br><code>14 Virginia 53.4%</code><br><code>15 Illinois 53.3%</code><br><code>16 Georgia 53.2%</code><br><code>17 Washington 53.1%</code></p><p>As the data shows, Louisiana and Rhode Island have the highest percentage of single females at 55.7%. New York follows closely behind with 55.4%, while Mississippi rounds out the top four with 54.9%. The remaining states on the list have a share of single females ranging from 54.6% to 53.1%.<br><br>When it comes to single females, the South and Northeast regions of the United States tend to have the highest concentrations. Louisiana, Rhode Island, New York, Mississippi, and Hawaii are all located in these regions. However, there are still plenty of states outside of these regions that have a high percentage of single females, such as Alaska, Florida, and Massachusetts.<br><br>It is important to note that these figures are based on the most recent census data from 2014. Since then, the population and demographics of each state have likely changed, so the data may not be completely accurate. Additionally, the data does not take into account other factors such as age, marital status, and location.<br><br>In conclusion, Louisiana and Rhode Island have the highest percentage of single females at 55.7%, followed by New York and Mississippi at 55.4% and 54.9%, respectively. The remaining states on the list have a share of single females ranging from 54.6% to 53.1%. While the South and Northeast regions of the United States tend to have the highest concentrations of single females, there are still plenty of states outside of these regions that have a high percentage of single females.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
