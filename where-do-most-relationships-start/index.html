While there is no one definitive answer, a new study from the University of Victoria suggests that the majority of romantic relationships begin as long-term friendships. This is contrary to the popular perception that love typically sparks from passion.<br><br><strong>Where do most relationships start?</strong><br>The University of Victoria's analysis of over 1,000 romantic relationships found that two-thirds of them began as long-term friendships. The study also found that the majority of relationships that started as friendships lasted longer than those that began as passionate love affairs.<br><br><strong>The Benefits of Starting a Relationship as Friends</strong><br>There are several benefits to starting a relationship as friends. For one, it allows for a deeper connection to be formed between two people. This connection is based on trust, understanding, and mutual respect, which can help create a strong foundation for a lasting relationship. Additionally, starting a relationship as friends allows both people to get to know each other on a deeper level before committing to a romantic relationship. This can help ensure that the relationship is based on more than just physical attraction.<br><br><strong>The Challenges of Starting a Relationship as Friends</strong><br>While there are many benefits to starting a relationship as friends, there are also some challenges. For example, it can be difficult to transition from being friends to being in a romantic relationship. This can be especially true if one person has stronger feelings for the other than the other person has for them. Additionally, if the relationship doesn't work out, it can be difficult to go back to being just friends.<br><br>Where do most relationships start?
