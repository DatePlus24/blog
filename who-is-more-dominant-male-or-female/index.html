While the answer to this question may depend on the context, in most mammals, including humans, males are larger than females and thus often considered dominant over females. This article will explore the differences between male and female dominance in the animal kingdom and provide an overview of the various factors that can influence dominance in both genders.<br><br><strong>What is Dominance?</strong><br><br>Dominance is a term used to describe the hierarchical relationships between individuals in a social group. In animals, dominance is often determined by physical size, strength, and aggression. In humans, dominance is often determined by social and cultural norms, as well as access to resources.<br><br><strong>Male Dominance in the Animal Kingdom</strong><br><br>In most species of animals, males are larger and stronger than females and thus often considered dominant. This is especially true in species that use physical aggression to establish dominance, such as primates and canines. In these species, males are typically more aggressive and territorial than females, and they often use physical force to assert their dominance.<br><br><strong>Female Dominance in the Animal Kingdom</strong><br><br>While males are often considered dominant in the animal kingdom, there are some species in which females are the dominant gender. In species such as elephants and horses, females are typically larger and stronger than males and thus more likely to establish dominance. In addition, some species of birds, such as geese and chickens, have a matriarchal social structure in which females are the dominant gender.<br><br><strong>Factors that Influence Dominance</strong><br><br>In addition to physical size and strength, there are a number of other factors that can influence dominance in both males and females. These include age, experience, social status, and access to resources. For example, in some species, older individuals are more likely to be dominant than younger individuals, and individuals with higher social status are more likely to be dominant than those with lower social status.<br><br>When it comes to dominance, the age-old question of who is more dominant, male or female, is still a source of debate. In most species of animals, males are larger and stronger than females and thus often considered dominant. However, there are some species in which females are the dominant gender, and there are a number of other factors that can influence dominance in both males and females. Ultimately, the answer to this question may depend on the context.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
