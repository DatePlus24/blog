According to data from 2012, 23% of men aged 25 and older had never been married, compared to 17% of women of the same age. This gender gap has widened since 1960, when 10% of men and 8% of women had never married.<br><br>Reasons for the Gender Gap<br><br>There are a number of factors that contribute to the gender gap in marriage. These include:<br><br>1. Economic Factors: Men are more likely to have higher levels of education and higher incomes than women, making them more attractive to potential partners. As a result, they may be more likely to delay marriage until they have achieved financial stability.<br><br>2. Social Factors: Men may be less likely to get married due to social pressures. For example, men may feel that marriage is not necessary or desirable, or that they should focus on their career first.<br><br>3. Cultural Factors: In some cultures, men are expected to take on more traditional roles, such as breadwinner and provider. This may lead to men delaying marriage until they are able to fulfill these roles.<br><br>4. Personal Factors: Men may be less likely to get married due to personal preferences. For example, they may prefer to remain single or may be less interested in long-term relationships.<br><br>Men are increasingly less likely to get married than women, and this gender gap has widened since 1960. This is due to a number of factors, including economic, social, cultural, and personal reasons. As a result, men may be more likely to delay marriage until they have achieved financial stability or until they are able to fulfill traditional roles.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="banner banner--after-post"><a href="https://siteoff.github.io/registration"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singleconnect24/img/main/clickUSA1.jpg" alt="Dating USA"></a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DatePlus24, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://dateplus24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
